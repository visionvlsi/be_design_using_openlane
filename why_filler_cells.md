#### why filler cells are used in vlsi

<p align="justify">Filler cells, also known as dummy cells, 
  are used in VLSI design to improve the uniformity of the layout and to prevent issues such as timing violations, electrostatic discharge (ESD), and electromigration.</p>

<p align="justify">In the VLSI design process, the layout of the integrated circuit is typically arranged in a grid-like pattern, with rows and columns of transistors
  and other components. However, this arrangement can sometimes result in irregularities in the layout, such as empty spaces or uneven spacing between components. 
  These irregularities can create issues with signal propagation, timing, and power consumption.</p>

<p align="justify">To address these issues, filler cells are placed in the empty spaces in the layout to ensure that the spacing between components is uniform and to
  improve the overall quality of the layout. These filler cells have the same dimensions as the other cells in the layout, but they are not connected to any of the
  circuitry and do not affect the performance of the circuit.</p>

<p align="justify">Additionally, filler cells can also help to reduce the effects of ESD and electromigration, which can cause damage to the circuitry over time. 
  By filling in empty spaces and ensuring that the layout is more uniform, filler cells can improve the reliability and performance of the integrated circuit.</p>

<p align="justify">In summary, filler cells are used in VLSI design to improve the uniformity and quality of the layout, to prevent issues with signal propagation, 
  timing, and power consumption, and to reduce the effects of ESD and electromigration.</p>
