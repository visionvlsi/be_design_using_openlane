#### in the IC design flow at what stage DFT is done?

Design-for-Testability (DFT) is typically done after the RTL synthesis stage and before the place and route stage in the IC design flow. DFT is an important step in the design process that ensures that the IC can be tested thoroughly and effectively during the manufacturing process. The goal of DFT is to add hardware features to the design that simplify the testing process, such as test access ports (TAPs), scan chains, and boundary scan cells.

The DFT process involves several steps, including testability analysis, test point insertion, scan chain insertion, and boundary scan insertion. Testability analysis involves analyzing the design to identify potential testing problems and determining the appropriate DFT techniques to use. Test point insertion involves inserting test points into the design to enable the measurement of internal signals during testing. Scan chain insertion involves adding scan chains to the design to enable the testing of sequential logic. Boundary scan insertion involves adding boundary scan cells to the design to enable the testing of I/O pins and inter-chip connections.

Once the DFT insertion is complete, the design is re-synthesized to ensure that the DFT features are correctly integrated into the design. The DFT features are then verified using simulation and test pattern generation tools to ensure that they function correctly and meet the required test coverage.

Overall, the DFT stage is a critical step in the IC design flow, as it ensures that the design can be tested effectively and reliably during the manufacturing process.

#### how is that done?

DFT is done using a combination of automated tools and manual design techniques. The process typically involves several stages, including testability analysis, test point insertion, scan chain insertion, boundary scan insertion, and verification.

1 Testability analysis: Testability analysis is the first step in the DFT process. It involves analyzing the design to identify potential testing problems and determining the appropriate DFT techniques to use. Testability analysis can be performed manually by experienced designers or using automated tools.

2 Test point insertion: Test point insertion involves inserting test points into the design to enable the measurement of internal signals during testing. Test points can be inserted at key points in the design using automated tools or manual techniques. The goal of test point insertion is to maximize test coverage while minimizing the impact on the design.

3 Scan chain insertion: Scan chain insertion involves adding scan chains to the design to enable the testing of sequential logic. Scan chains allow the internal state of the design to be scanned out and back in, making it easier to test. Scan chain insertion can be performed using automated tools or manual techniques.

4 Boundary scan insertion: Boundary scan insertion involves adding boundary scan cells to the design to enable the testing of I/O pins and inter-chip connections. Boundary scan cells allow the state of the I/O pins to be scanned in and out, making it easier to test. Boundary scan insertion can be performed using automated tools or manual techniques.

5 Verification: Once the DFT features are inserted into the design, the design is re-synthesized to ensure that the DFT features are correctly integrated into the design. The DFT features are then verified using simulation and test pattern generation tools to ensure that they function correctly and meet the required test coverage.

Overall, DFT is a complex and iterative process that requires a combination of automated tools and manual design techniques. The goal of DFT is to ensure that the design can be tested effectively and reliably during the manufacturing process.
