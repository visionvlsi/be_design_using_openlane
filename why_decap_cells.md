<p align="justify">Decap cells, short for decoupling capacitors, play an important role in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) physical design by helping to reduce 
  noise and improve the stability of the power supply network.</p>

<p align="justify">In an integrated circuit, there are often many different blocks and components that require power to operate. These blocks draw power from the 
  power supply network, which consists of metal wires and vias that distribute power throughout the circuit. However, as the circuit operates, it can create 
  electrical noise that can interfere with other components and degrade the performance of the circuit.</p>

<p align="justify">Decap cells are inserted in the power supply network to help reduce this electrical noise and improve the stability of the power supply voltage. 
  They work by storing electrical charge in a capacitor, which can be quickly discharged when needed to supply additional current to the circuit. 
  This helps to maintain a more stable voltage level and reduce the effects of electrical noise on the circuit.</p>

<p align="justify">Decap cells are typically placed close to the power pins of the circuit components they are intended to serve, and are strategically placed to 
  provide maximum decoupling effectiveness. The placement and number of decap cells needed in a design depend on various factors such as the size and complexity 
  of the design, the operating frequency, and the voltage requirements of the components.</p>

<p align="justify">Overall, decap cells are an important component of VLSI physical design, helping to improve the stability and performance of integrated circuits 
  by reducing noise and improving the power supply network.</p>
