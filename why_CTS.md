#### what exactly is clock tree synthesis in vlsi physical design

<p align="justify">
Clock tree synthesis (CTS) is a critical step in VLSI physical design that involves the creation of a clock distribution network within an integrated circuit.
  The purpose of CTS is to ensure that the clock signal reaches all the sequential elements of the circuit in a timely and synchronized manner,
  while minimizing power consumption and maximizing performance.</p>

<p align="justify">In a VLSI design, the clock signal is used to synchronize the operation of the sequential elements such as flip-flops and registers. 
  The clock signal is typically generated externally to the chip and is distributed through a network of metal wires and buffers to reach all the sequential 
  elements in the circuit.</p>

<p align="justify">The clock distribution network is designed to meet timing constraints and reduce clock skew, which is the difference in arrival times of the 
  clock signal at different parts of the circuit. The clock skew can cause issues such as setup and hold violations, which can lead to incorrect operation of the circuit.</p>

<p align="justify">The CTS process involves the insertion of buffers, also known as inverters, into the clock distribution network to improve the timing and 
  reduce the clock skew. The buffers are placed in such a way that they divide the clock signal into multiple branches, which then reach all the sequential elements
  of the circuit.</p>

<p align="justify">The CTS process also involves optimization techniques to minimize the power consumption of the clock distribution network. 
  This is achieved by optimizing the placement of buffers and using techniques such as clock gating, where parts of the clock distribution network 
  are turned off when they are not needed.</p>

<p align="justify">Overall, clock tree synthesis is a critical step in VLSI physical design that ensures the timely and synchronized delivery of the clock 
  signal to all the sequential elements of the circuit, while minimizing power consumption and maximizing performance.</p>
